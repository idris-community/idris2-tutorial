## Styling and Formatting

### ipkg modules

Please ensure that the modules listing in [`tutorial.ipkg`](./tutorial.ipkg) remains sorted in chapter order.

### Avoid First Person Singular

Avoid the use of first person singular pronouns ("I", "me", etc), and instead prefer the use of first person plural pronouns ("We", "us", etc). This is a community product, and the language should reflect the collective ownership.
