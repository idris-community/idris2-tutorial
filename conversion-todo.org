* DONE Get CI up and running
* DONE Fix that whole extra line breaks bug
* DONE Rewrite README
** DONE Link to SUMMARY.md
** DONE Document building mdbook
** DONE Move some of the existing prose to a preface chapter
* DONE Build docker container locally instead of using one from my personal forgejo
* STRT Break Chapters into sub-chapters as appropriate
* TODO Inject highlighted repl output
** TODO Actual test injection
Thread local IDEMode?
** TODO Golden Tests
Should golden test the repl outputs to detect breakage

These should also be compared in a whitespace insensitive way, im thinking, like:
#+begin_src markdown
```repl-session
> length ["lines that start with > are repl commands"]
1
> length ["subsequent lines before the next", "are the golden output"]
2
```
#+end_src

This keeps it readable as a raw markdown document, but provides easy processing for extraction and injection of the /actual/ repl output complete with highlighting.
** TODO Special Handling for exec
* TODO Add links from github to mdbook and from mdbook to github
This one's best done after migrating to the community project so we can have the correct url
* TODO Rewrite prose to remove use of first person
As this is becoming a community maintained tutorial, the prose should reflect the collective ownership and avoid the use of first person pronouns.
* TODO Selenized custom themes
Because I love myself
* TODO Audit links
* TODO Figure out excercise soultions situation
* TODO Clean up fixity declarations
* TODO Consistent on summary vs conclusion
* TODO Place modules and visibility primer upfront
* IDEA Rename Modules To Chapter/Subchapter number?
Could also potentially insert automatic linking?
