# Conclusion

Dependent pairs and records are necessary to at runtime inspect the values defining the types we work with. By pattern matching on these values, we learn about the types and possible shapes of other values, allowing us to reduce the number of potential bugs in our programs.

In the [next chapter](Eq.md) we start learning about how to write data types, which we use as proofs that certain contracts between values hold. These will eventually allow us to define pre- and post conditions for our function arguments and output types.
