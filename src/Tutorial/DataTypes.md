# Algebraic Data Types

In the previous chapter, we learned how to write our own functions and combine them to create more complex functionality. Of equal importance is the ability to define our own data types and use them as arguments and results in functions.

This is a lengthy chapter, densely packed with information. If you are new to Idris and functional programming, make sure to follow along slowly, experimenting with the examples, and possibly coming up with your own. Make sure to try and solve *all* exercises.
