# Background and further Reading

Concepts like *functor* and *monad* have their origin in *category theory*, a branch of mathematics. That is also where their laws come from. Category theory was found to have applications in programming language theory, especially functional programming. It is a highly abstract topic, but there is a pretty accessible introduction for programmers, written by [Bartosz Milewski](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/).

The usefulness of applicative functors as a middle ground between functor and monad was discovered several years after monads had already been in use in Haskell. They were introduced in the article [*Applicative Programming with Effects*](https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.html), which is freely available online and a highly recommended read.
