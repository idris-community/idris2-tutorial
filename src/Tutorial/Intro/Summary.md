# Summary

In this introduction we learned about the most basic features of the Idris
programming language. We used the REPL to tinker with our ideas and inspect the
types of things in our code, and we used the Idris compiler to compile an Idris
source file to an executable.

We also learned about the basic shape of a top level definition in Idris, which
always consists of an identifier (its name), a type, and an implementation.

## What's next?

In the next chapter, we start programming in Idris for real. We learn how to
write our own pure functions, how functions compose, and how we can treat
functions just like other values and pass them around as arguments to other
functions.
