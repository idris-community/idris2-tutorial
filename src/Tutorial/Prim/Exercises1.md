# Exercises part 1

In these exercises, you are supposed to implement a bunch of utility functions for consuming and converting strings. I don't give the expected types here, because you are supposed to come up with those yourself.

1. Implement functions similar to `map`, `filter`, and `mapMaybe` for strings. The output type of these should always be a string.

2. Implement functions similar to `foldl` and `foldMap` for strings.

3. Implement a function similar to `traverse` for strings. The output type should be a wrapped string.

4. Implement the bind operator for strings. The output type should again be a string.
